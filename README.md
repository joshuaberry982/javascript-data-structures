# JavaScript Data Structures

This repository is used for JavaScript Data Structures.

Some data structures such as a Linked List require the use of other data structures such as Nodes, however, it isn't necessary to download all required files for the data structure (ie. Node.js and LinkedList.js for a Linked List) and instead just the file you need (so for a Linked List, you only need to use LinkedList.js).

Feel free to use these repo however is necessary.
