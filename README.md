# JavaScript Data Structures

This repository is used for JavaScript Data Structures.

Some data structures such as a Linked List require the use of other data structures such as Nodes, however, it *isn't necessary in this repository* to download all required files for the data structure (ie. Node.js and LinkedList.js for a Linked List). Instead, you can copy or download just the file you need (so for a Linked List, you only need to use LinkedList.js).

Feel free to use these repo however is necessary.
